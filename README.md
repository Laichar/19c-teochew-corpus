# 19th Century Teochew Vocabulary and Example Sentences Corpus

## Aim
We aim to collect vocabulary and example sentences of the 19th Century Teochew dialect as described in grammars and primers in Roman phonetic transcription written by missionaries and Teochews themselves such as Gibson, Dean, Fielde, Steele, Giles, Goddard, Duffus, Ashmore and Lim Hiong Seng, mainly collecting data through scans of those works.

We are a volunteer project so we encourage you to join if you have:
* knowledge of a Min dialect, and
* knowledge/experience with POJ, Tâi-lô, PUJ, BUC, or other roman transcriptions of Min
* an ability to read Chinese characters
